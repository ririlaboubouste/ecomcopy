</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">PERSONAL INFORMATION: The type of information we collect from you depends on how you use our Sites. Generally, when using our Sites, we may collect personal information in two ways: (i) you provide it to us, or (ii) it is collected automatically. You may provide personal information to us, such as your first and last name, contact information, email address, image, Username, physical address, and contents of your communication. You may also provide payment information to our third party payment processors. Information that could be used to identify or contact you is considered “Personal Information” under this Privacy Policy.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">&nbsp;We may use your information, including your Personal Information, for the following purposes:
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">To better understand how Users access and use our Sites, both on an aggregated and individual User basis, on individual Sites and across them in order to improve our Sites and respond to User desires and preferences, and for other research and analytical purposes;
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">To provide our services to you, which may include communicating with you about your use of our Sites and services, responding to your inquiries, troubleshooting problems, working with our third-party providers to process your orders and for other customer service purposes;
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, provide personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Sites;
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">For marketing, and promotional purposes, including, for example, to send you news and newsletters, promotions, or to otherwise contact you about projects, opportunities or information we think may interest you provided you have opted into receiving such communications from us; to administer surveys and questionnaires; and
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">To protect our own rights and interests, such as to resolve any disputes, enforce our Terms of Use, and to respond to legal requests.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">In the interests of educational research around ECOMCOPY CONSULTING LLC values and teachings such as human-centered approaches and design thinking. ECOMCOPY CONSULTING LLC has affiliations with many educational establishments including but not limited to Harvard and Stanford University for this purpose.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">To allow you to access and register for our services more easily (e.g in the setting up of personal profile accounts through third-party businesses you are already signed up to, such as Facebook or Google).
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">We only collect the minimum amount of Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving the aforementioned purposes.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other Users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">If you submit any Personal Information to us in response to a job posting (e.g. your resume), this may be shared with third parties (including external tools and services we use to manage our talent pool), depending on the nature of your inquiry. Personal Information collected in this capacity will be used solely for the purpose specified; such information is not subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">In general, ECOMCOPY CONSULTING LLC will gather some technical information automatically. This information includes your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address (often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your Internet service provider (“ISP”), your company or your university), browser type, referring/exit pages, the files viewed on our Site (e.g., HTML pages, graphics, etc.), operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">NON-IDENTIFYING INFORMATION: Certain information that does not identify you (“Non-Identifying Information”) would only be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other Non-Identifying Information (for example, your country and gender). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Users of the Sites to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Sites, and to analyze and understand how the Sites are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product or service to you according to your preferences or restrictions, or to send you User surveys or requests for feedback. We may collect any Personal Information you provide through such surveys or calls for feedback.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">SOCIAL MEDIA INFORMATION
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">Where you have interacted with ECOMCOPY CONSULTING LLC sites, content or even employees, through channels such as social media channels we may collect this information using our automated marketing tool. This means that where you have provided certain information (such as email address) to us before and/or have opted in to receiving communications from ECOMCOPY CONSULTING LLC, we may use your interactions with us on social media, combined with information we already have about you to establish your preferences and provide more targeted content.

For example, some of the information is collected so that when you visit the Sites again, we will recognize you and provide you with information appropriate to your interests. We also use the information to verify that the visitors to our Sites met the criteria to process their requests.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">&nbsp;DO-NOT-TRACK: Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests. You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of Internet-based advertising by following the instructions above in this Cookies section.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">&nbsp;REGARDING CHILDREN AND MINORS: We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from Users under the age of 13 (“Child” or “Children”).

</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">OTHER CORPORATE ENTITIES: We may share your information, including your Personal Information, Non-Identifying Information and Log Data, with our affiliates, subsidiaries, and branch offices in the United States and internationally, and with third parties who provide services on our behalf to help with our business activities such as providing email distribution services, customer service, or technical support. These companies are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 19.2px;">&nbsp;ECOMCOPY CONSULTING LLC ADVERTISING ON AND USE OF DATA WITH THIRD PARTY PLATFORMS: We may share data collected on the Sites, including email addresses, to show you and others personalized advertisements on third party websites and online services such as Facebook, Google, Pinterest, Snapchat, TikTok, Adobe and Linkedin and other Social Media providers. In order to facilitate this, we may share data collected on the Sites with third parties who will help us identify user profiles to target in our advertising campaigns, and analyze and maximize the effectiveness of the Site and our advertising and marketing outreach initiatives.
